# I am actively learning HTML/CSS, Git, as well as client-server architecture from tutorials on the web. I 
started with python tutorials, so that is something I am learning as well. From the research I did, this seems like
a decent starting point for learning development and/or programming. I look forward to progressing and using
Github to store projects and learning progress.
